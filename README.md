# Kaggle-Bike-Sharing-Demand
In this machine learning project from kaggle, we are required to estimate the total number of rented bikes given various climatic and other features.

This repository contains two versions with two different approaches.

  1.In the first approach I have implemented a decision tree.(Score obtained is 0.551)
  
  2.In the second one I replaced the decision tree with the Random forest.(Score obtained is 0.515)
    Along with that completely new and highly interactive charts and graphs have been added to this file.
    
    PS:There is an interactive and dynamic chart after line 10(not visible in the viewer on git.)
    
    Please download and run the same on your jupyter notebook to view (Completely interactive). 
    
    Although a screenshot of the same has been added in png for reference (Non interactive).

My Kaggle username is "sidagar" without quotes.
