# Kaggle-Bike-Sharing-Demand
In this machine learning project from kaggle, we are required to estimate the total number of rented bikes given various climatic and other features.

This repository contains three versions with three different approaches.

  1.In the first approach I have implemented a decision tree.(Score obtained is 0.551)
  
  2.In the second one I replaced the decision tree with the Random forest.(Score obtained is 0.515)
  
  3.In the third one I have used a combination of XGBoost and Random Forest.(Score obtained was 0.492) 
  
    PS:There are interactive and dynamic plotly charts in the 2nd and 3rd files(not visible in the viewer on git.)
    
    Please download and run the same on your jupyter notebook to view (Completely interactive).
    Alternatively one can also visit "https://www.kaggle.com/sidagar/bike-sharing-demand" to view the latest version.
    
    Although a screenshot of the first chart has been added in png for reference in the repository (Non interactive).
